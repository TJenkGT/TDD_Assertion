# TDD_Assertion
The goal from this homework assignment is for you to add testing infrastructure to code that you've already written. This will be a little different, and might be a bit of a challenge depending on how you've approached your previous homework assignments. If need be, you can use one of the homework solutions provided previously.  Your goal is to pick a few pieces of your code that you want to refactor so you can write unit tests for it. The end result of your app should not change!
